## What is TTYSH?

For too long the TTY has been dismissed as the part of Linux where the Linux user shouldn't be because it lacks a graphical environment. TTYSH is a script that gives the TTY back to the user. Using automation and the Linux framebuffer, TTYSH turns your TTY into a full "desktop" with a graphical web browser, video playback, image viewing, just to name a few, and all of this is possible without a graphical environment.
