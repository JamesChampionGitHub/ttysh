ISSUES:

Done: yay install asking to Y/n. --noconfirm not working. 
	Fix: --noconfirm added to makepkg. Needs testing.

Done: mutt configuration file missing when issuing mu.
	Fix: hopefully, mkdir -p directory for mutt and touch muttrc. Needs testing.

Done: notes and birthdays files are missing.
	Fix: hopefully, correct paths now. Needs testing.

Done: Not automating Y on installtion of go.
	Fix: hopefully, installing go before yay to avoid the issue. Needs testing.

Done: Random opening of fzf before Browsh, something weird with opening.
	Fix: hopefully, needed to exit out special characters with the \ echo commands. Needs testing.

Done: move TTYSH to /usr/lib/bin thing, and chmod/chown it to root. 
	Fix: as above. Requires more testing.

ToDo: Random ttysh.sh generation?
	Possible fix: see above.

Done: hasn't made muttrc?
	Fix: hopefully, see regarding issue with fzf, exiting out of "". Needs testing.


COMPLETED:

Done: yt-dlp needs to save the videos and music in the Videos directory. Tested.

Done: splash screen: added, but requires if statement located in the /usr/local/ for mpv and config
NOTE: future usage of [[]] to be done.

Done: splash screen: devour window in xorg

No: if xorg for lock screen and fzf video etc...
NOTE: not adding, as impractical. Should drop to TTY to lock.
